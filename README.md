Behold! Bamazon is an ingenious knock-off of Amazon! 

Using Node, the user can invoke the customer function.

This will call up a table displaying Bamazon's database, and ask what item you'd like to purchase:

Here we have selected item # 10, the Johnny Walker Whiskey. Once the selection has been made, Bamazon will ask how many items you'd like to purchase. Here the user has chosen to purchase 22 items.

Because there was enough stock available,  Bamaon displays a message that the transaction was successful. Bamazon then displays a table with the updated inventory.

Here the user has selected the Mesh Shirt, and requested 50 units. Because the requested units exceeds the available stock, Bamazon displays an error message, and redisplays the table with the option to make a new purchase.

This will display a table of Bamazon's inventory. Bamazon will then prompt the user to select an item to add stock to, then input the number of units to add. Here the user has selected to add to Bamazon's store of monkeys, and add 100 animals to the inventory.

Bamazon will then prompt the user to provide the product's name, select its department, provide the product's price, and finally indicate how many units will be added to its stock. Here the user has added Samsung Galaxy 8 to the electronics department, and set a price of 900 and a stock of 500.
